      Graduated from the Faculty of Engineering with a Bachelor's Degree in
      Architecture, and the Faculty of Art & Design with a Master of Art at the
      International Balkan University - Skopje.


      I develop Visual Identities and User Interfaces & Experiences. Each
      project has its specific identity, which I thoroughly research and
      translate into visual design, using my knowledge, experience, and
      methodology. Developing graphic systems and visual languages that help
      define my clients' specific visual identity and their customers' needs.


      Whether working with a large corporation, a small company, or an
      individual - I approach projects with the highest degree of attention to
      detail and ambition. Having the design experience in developing visual
      identities and UI / UX on a wide variety of projects ranging from Web
      Apps, SaaS

      Businesses, AI Apps, Finance & Investment firms, all the way to Hotels -
      my design skills cover everything from larger to smaller scales and
      requirements.


      With growing interest in the User Experience aspect of design, trying to
      thoroughly understand the psychology behind our work & what I develop for
      my clients. To utilize the tools and knowledge that we designers have at
      hand, in hopes of providing better service, accessibility, and clarity for
      users all over the globe.
