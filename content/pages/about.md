      Graduated from the Faculty of Engineering with a bachelor's degree in
      Architecture, and the Faculty of Art & Design with a Master of Art at the
      International Balkan University - Skopje.


      Having the design experience in developing visual identities and UI / UX
      on a wide variety of projects ranging from web apps, SaaS

      businesses, AI apps, finance & investment firms, all the way to lounge
      bars & hotels - my design skills cover everything from larger to smaller
      scales and requirements.


      With growing interest in the User Experience aspect of design, trying to
      thoroughly understand the psychology behind our work & what I develop for
      my clients. To utilize the tools that we designers have at hand, in hopes
      of providing better service, accessibility, and clarity.


      A  believer and supporter of the idea that in today's modern world, we
      need to make sure that we communicate visually as well, if not better,
      than we do with our words.
