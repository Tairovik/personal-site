      Graduated from the Faculty of Engineering with a bachelor's degree in
      Architecture, and the Faculty of Art & Design with a Master of Art at the
      International Balkan University - Skopje. 


      Previously a founder & creative director at the design studio The Sign,
      and currently an Assistant Professor at the International Balkan
      University - lecturing the classes of "History of Architecture and Art I &
      II" and "Introduction to Art and Culture I\&II"


      Having the design experience on developing visual identities on a wide
      variety of projects for clients such as lounge bars, hotels, finance
      firms, and handcrafted business - my designing range covers everything
      from larger to smaller scales and requirements.


      With a growing interest in the User Experience aspect of design, trying to
      thoroughly understand the psychology behind our work & what I develop for
      my clients, in order to utilize the tools that we designers have at hand
      in hopes of providing better service, accessibility, and clarity.


      A strong believer and supporter of the idea that in today's modern world,
      we need to make sure that we communicate visually as well, if not better,
      than we do with our words.
