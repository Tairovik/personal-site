      The values I wanted to represent were Harmony, Nature, Hospitality and
      Excellence.


      The logo designed for Paradise focuses on visually showcasing those
      values, with a hint of warmth and relaxation. I managed to achieve it
      through the implementation of the carefully picked color palette and
      precisely designed lotus element.

      The timeless combination of a modern sans-serif and a serif typography
      combination. 


      Paired with the sunset inspired color palette, utilized across the brand
      pattern as well - we get two great puzzle pieces that perfectly fit into
      the development of the Paradise brand.

      The visual identity is applied on all the required elements of a hotel,
      such as the key cards and door hangers. Due to the nature of the design
      work, I made sure that we have the option of being flexible and scalable,
      such that the branding can be used and evolved in the future based on the
      needs of the clients business.
