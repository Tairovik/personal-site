      US Aid in cooperation with the "Health Above All" organization reached out
      to me, requesting my guidance and design for their project. The book is of
      educational character, teaching its readers how to properly take care of,
      and improve their mental & physical health.


      Due to the character of the project - it was more than a pleasure to be a
      part of it. My values stand and will always aim towards helping and
      contributing to the community's safety and health.

      The overall looks we went for were pastel, friendly colors in the shades
      of blue and green. The cover has a clear and bold typographic title, with
      a minimalistic polygonal background which is seen across the whole book.
      It is meant to represent all the small pieces that make us people from the
      combination of characteristics that we are.


      I also handled the Print Design portion of the project, organizing the
      text and picture layouts in harmony. Our priority was accessibility and
      ease of use, and understanding of content for the readers.
