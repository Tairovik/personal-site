Through the combination of the timeless typeface, and the golden accent line – we got the desired product for our client.\_\n\nWe designed two versions of the Hindamy logo, the Wordmark for general use and brand representation, and the Icon for mobile application purposes.\n"

      The Hindamy branding – utilized on the Hindamy application. We made sure
      that the minimalistic, yet elegant and luxurious feeling of the brand is
      present and felt through the design of the application itself.


      To get to the desired destination, we went through the creation of
      multiple prototypes and screens, as well as the creation of a wide range
      of custom categories icons that match the whole visual identity of the
      brand.
