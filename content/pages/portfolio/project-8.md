      The landing & supporting pages for the upcoming analytics platform in the
      Middle East & North Africa Region. Focusing on giving its user easy access
      and use of the data they need to drive their businesses forward -
      increasing their marketing performance through intelligent data solutions
      which the platform provides.


      Starting from the low fidelity mockups, and getting all the way to the
      final screens is always a process of trial and error. This ensures that
      the product which we create is fully up for the purpose & the users it
      needs to serve.


      Making sure that throughout the whole design process of the project we
      meet our user's needs, provide clear hierarchy in terms of which elements
      and controls are more important - thus keeping the consistency and
      standards at a familiar look and feel.

      The account & team pages for the users of the platform, where they can
      organize their data pipes, check their data usage, manage their teams, and
      integrate the data sources with other instances.


      They were designed to help our users recognize & diagnose everything that
      is happening with their data. Without overwhelming the visual aspect, the
      minimalism helps us showcase what is of most importance, which helps out
      users focus on their goals without any distraction.

      sure that its' users will have a clear view on what's going on the
      platform, with intuitive controls to provide ease of control.


      With a usability first approach, all of the required functions are no more
      than two interactions away, which makes the workflow of the admin fluid
      and in turn increases their productivity.


      The gained end result is a product with consistent and accessible design,
      removing any obstacles from our users and the usage of data to their
