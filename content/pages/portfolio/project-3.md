      The life of a painting or of painting series begins at the moment of its
      blurry conception, develops through the process of physical execution and,
      in a true sense, continues to communicate when shared in any reproduced,
      determined form. The exhibition, on the other hand, is simply a controlled
      representation of the whole in a spatial installation as seen through the
      artist's prism.

      “Spaces of Oblivion” rises from a long-term exploration that started back
      in 2017. The series consists of sixty paintings in different formats,
      painted with acrylic on canvas, along with digital paintings, worked on a
      photographic model. A common denominator is that the paintings depict
      interiors of public institutions, buildings built in the 1970s as part of
      the modern architecture in Skopje - buildings.

      The poster & catalogue design were made in a way that encapsulates the
      feeling of the exhibition's artistic collection - communicating the
      feelings gained from the show as a preview to the observer's eye.
