      Inspired by the NASA Mission, All Up is a Cloud Financial Operations
      platform, enabling teams to make business trade-offs between speed, cost
      and quality. 


      The logo stands for the letter "A", and symbolizes a rocket pointing
      upwards, with the slope pointing upwards representing growth and motion.

      Going for the Cobalt Blue & Amethyst Pink hues which psychologically
      looking at colors represent loyalty, trust, organization & ambition.


      The typography is composed of the sleek looking Montserrat which we use
      across the User Interface & Body Paragraphs, and the Merriweather serif
      font as a Header choice.

      The brand guidelines put to use across our web app & user interface. Right
      from the get-go, we see the noticeable color palette & typography choices
      which look great together.


      We also made sure for the whole user experience to be at it's pinnacle -
      not compromising any accessibility or legibility for the price of looks.
