  - content: "The Red Castle of Tripoli is the main cornerstone of the brand identity which I developed. The logo is made out of de-constructed minimalist\r\nrendering of the castle tower, with the symbolic window opening on it. As a core logo piece, we pick out the top right corner. \n\nThe castle element is also used in sense that it represents trust, safety, sovereignty, strategy and wealth - the values which the brand stands for.\n"

      Going for the colors which we chose for our palette, represent the same
      values which are mentioned in our logo designing process -  the trust,
      sovereignty, strategy & wealth.


      The typography is composed of the sleek looking Montserrat which we use
      across the User Interface & Body Paragraphs, and the Merriweather serif
      font as a Header choice.
