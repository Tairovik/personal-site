  - content: "The Red Castle of Tripoli is the main cornerstone of the brand identity which I developed. The logo is made out of de-constructed minimalist\r\nrendering of the castle tower, with the symbolic window opening on it. As a core logo piece, we pick out the top right corner. \n\nThe castle element is also used in sense that it represents trust, safety, sovereignty, strategy and wealth - the values which the brand stands for.\n"

      Going for the colors which we chose for our palette, represent the same
      values which are mentioned in our logo designing process -  the trust,
      safety, sovereignty, strategy & wealth.


      A timeless combination between a Serif & Sans Serif typography - we're
      going for the sleek looking Open Sans and the Trirong serif font.

      Through the usage of our brand design assets, we manage to get the website
      looking creative & modern. A significant touch to the design aspect, is
      the usage of our castle element of the logo, as a watermark on top of our
      pictorial content. It gives a positive increase to the branding sense, and
      ties the whole project well together.
