Accessibility remains one of the most important topics across multiple industries, yet mental health & anxiety, donâ€™t often come to mind as a piece of the puzzle.

As designers, we need to ask ourselves - what mental health hurdles may be unintentional consequences of our work?

Even though our world is becoming significantly digital, we need to think of how difficult certain digital forms can be in terms of accessibility. Certain health conditions & disabilities and their side effects, such as insomnia, headaches, fatigue, etc. come in many forms and make the digital world difficult for the user.

The first step would be to make sure to distinguish between a technical glitch and human error. Without proper messaging to explain the cause and the next steps, some maybe completely lost - continuing to beat themselves up for thinking they made a mistake. And if it is a human error, make sure to nicely communicate it to them on how to fix it, or better yet to see what we could do to prevent it in first place.

Look at it this way - is there any chance for our users to remember every account they've ever created, especially with all the different password requirements? Adding on top of that platforms which we use maybe once or twice a year, or some where we create an account in the middle of another longer form - or ones created for us by our employers and such?

#### So, what can we do about it?
